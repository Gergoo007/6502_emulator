## Some Inforamtion
Coding Style
Register names: always UPPERCASE

The processor status register consists of 8 bits (1 byte):
0. Carry flag			:C: 9th bit of ADC (addition) result
1. Zero flag			:Z: 0 if result is not zero, 1 if result is 0
2. IRQ disable flag		:I: Set by SEI (set interrupt disable), cleared by CLI (clear interrupt flag)
3. Decimal mode flag	:D: 1 if true, 0 if false
4. Break Command flag	:B: 
5. UNUSED				:-: 
6. Overflow flag		:V: 1 if true, 0 if false
7. Negative flag		:N: 1 if result is negative, 0 if result is positive

The stack ranges from 0x1ff to 0x100.
It is "upside down" in the memory: the "bottom" (beginning) of the stack is at 0x1ff, the "top" (end) is at 0x100 + SP.
